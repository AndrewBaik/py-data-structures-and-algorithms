# Stack

## Summary
- Implemented Node and Stack classes in python.

### Node
- Holdes the attributes of `val` and `_next`

### Stack
- Create a Class for a Stack which creates an empty Stack when instantiated.
- `len` method, which represents the count of Nodes in the stack at any time.
- Accept an iterable as an argument when instantiated.
- Support user functionality and informative responses through use of `repr` and `str`.
- `push`, which takes any value as an argument and adds that value to the top of the stack with an O(1) Time performance.
- `pop`, which takes no arguments and removes / returns the Node at the top of the stack.
- `peek`, which takes no arguments and returns the Node at the top of the stack.

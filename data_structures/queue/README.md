# Queue

## Summary
- Implemented Node and Queue classes in python.

### Node
- Holdes the attributes of `val` and `_next`

### Queue

- Create a Class for a Queue which creates an empty Queue when instantiated.
- `len` method, which represents the count of Nodes in the stack at any time.
- Accept an iterable as an argument when instantiated.
- Support user functionality and informative responses through use of `repr` and `str`.
- `enqueue`, which takes any value as an argument and adds that value to the rear of the queue with an O(1) Time performance.
- `dequeue`, which takes no arguments and removes / returns the Node at the front of the queue.

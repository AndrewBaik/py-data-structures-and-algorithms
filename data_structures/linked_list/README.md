# Linked List

## Summary
- Implemented Node and Linked List abstract classes in python 3.

### Node
- Holdes the attributes of `val` and `_next`

### Linked List
- Implement insert(), when method gets called with an argument of an integer, a new Node gets created and attached in the head of linked list.
- Implemented includes(), when method gets called with an argument of an integer, it will iterate through the linked list to find the input integer equal to the Node value within the linked list and return a boolean.
- Implement constructor that has an option to take a list of integer. Then it will create a Nodes with the values included in the list and insert it into the linked list.

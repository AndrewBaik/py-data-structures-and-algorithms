# Graph

## Summary
- Implement a graph class

## Methods
- `add_vert`, takes a value as an argument, validates if it's already included, if not, it adds to the graph
- `has_vert`, validates if the given value is already added into the graph. Returns in boolean
- `add_edge`, takes two values and a weight, validates and adds the value of the edge between two verticies.
- `get_neighbors`, takes a value as an argument, returns a list of verticies that is connected to the given value.
- `breadth_first`, takes a value and returns a list of neighbors inside the graph.

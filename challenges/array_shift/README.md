# Array Shift

## Summary
- Given a list and an element, place the element in the middle index of list and return the list without using any of the built-in methods

## Solution
- First, I identified the middle number of index, and iterate through the given list and assign it to a new list using for loop. When the counter hits the mid number, assign the given input to a new list. Iterate through the given list to assign the rest of the elements to the new elements.

# Binary Search

## Summary
- Write a function which takes two arguments which are sorted list and search key. Without utilizing any built-in method, return the index of the list's element that is equal to the search key, or -1 if the element is not included in the sorted list.

## Solution
- Within the application, I've identified middle index integer and compare its value to the given key. Based on validation of two integer, I reassigned the either low or high and recalculated for the mid. Eventually, if given key is equal to its index value of mid, it wi'll return the mid otherwise returns '-1'.
- I created additional function that takes two integers and calculate an average integer to get the mid index number with given low and high integers.
